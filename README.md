# Vehicle-Inventory
This is a simple console application which uses SOLID principles to perform various tasks.

Create a simple text-based Console Application in C# to maintain a catalog of used vehicles. Vehicle can be of types- Car, Bike etc. 
The catalog keeps track of each vehicles owner details, model, year, distance and purchase value. Calculate each vehicles sale price 
on your own based on car or bike. The program can perform the following operations:
 Add Vehicles to the catalog
 Display all the Vehicles.
 Search vehicles based on Age (ex: n year old)
 Search vehicle based on Sale Price

Vehicle, which is more than 10 years should not include in the catalog
Use appropriate OOPS concepts to implement the system
(Make sure your program should be simple enough to do future modifications if any given)
